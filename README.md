.....................Leads vs customers....................

**Lead**     
- A person or organization that has *shown interest* in your product or service, but hasn’t bought yet.    
- Early stage — prospecting / lead generation       
- Someone who filled out a form, downloaded an eBook, or attended your webinar 


**Customer** |
- A person or organization that has *purchased* from you or *signed a contract* (i.e., they’ve converted). 
- Later stage — post-sale / relationship management 
- Someone who paid for your product or subscribed to your service              |
