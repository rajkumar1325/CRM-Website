.....................Leads vs customers....................

**Lead**     
- A person or organization that has *shown interest* in your product or service, but hasn’t bought yet.    
- Early stage — prospecting / lead generation       
- Someone who filled out a form, downloaded an eBook, or attended your webinar 


**Customer** |
- A person or organization that has *purchased* from you or *signed a contract* (i.e., they’ve converted). 
- Later stage — post-sale / relationship management 
- Someone who paid for your product or subscribed to your service              |








💻 What to Display in the Deals Section
Just like your Customer and Support sections, the Deals section should show a grid or list of deals.
Each card or row might include:

- Deal Name / Company
- Stage & Probability
- Deal Value
- Expected Close Date
- Status badge (Active / Won / Lost)
- Assigned To

- A “View” button (opens modal with full details)

className always takes "string" or "expression"
